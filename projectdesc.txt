Konekté will be a dynamic web application that serves as a centralized platform for discovering, creating, and managing events across Mauritius. It connects event organizers with the general public, offering a user-friendly space to list, browse, and participate in a wide range of events — from large concerts and community gatherings to private seminars and online conferences.

Users can browse and filter events by type, location, or organizer, book or cancel tickets, set reminders, and join online events.

Organizers can create, update, and manage events, track bookings, accept payments or donations, and choose event visibility (public/private).

We will have a list of contributors to small events.

Admins can oversee the platform, manage content, cancel events, and access site-wide statistics.

There is currently no unified platform in Mauritius that groups all types of events — from public to private, physical to virtual. Konekté fills this gap by offering:

Centralized listings of all event types

Tools for organizers to promote and monetize their events

A streamlined booking and ticketing system for users

Custom visibility for institutions and private gatherings

Individuals discovering and attending local or virtual events

NGOs and communities hosting social or cultural activities

Businesses organizing internal or public-facing events

Institutions managing conferences, workshops, or trainings

To become Mauritius’ go-to platform for events of every kind — fostering connection, participation, and community through accessible, inclusive, and organized event experiences.
